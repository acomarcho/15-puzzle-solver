# How to run
Make sure you have Python (https://www.python.org/) and these following packages:
1. numpy
2. eel

You can install both packages by first installing pip (https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and running these commands:
```
pip install numpy
pip install eel
```

After making sure you have both, you can just go to the /bin folder and run this inside the command prompt:
```
python solver.py
```

# Editing testcases
Inside the /bin folder, you can change the testcases located in the /test folder. Please note that 16 corresponds to an empty tile inside the matrix.
